# Welcome to the CUDA Skin Detector

## This project is both an implementation of a CUDA Skin detector, and a short guide on how to configure a CMake CUDA project.

It covers the basis for creating a functional library that uses CUDA and OpenCV. In later stages, we show how to use this library in an executable. The project takes advantage of modern CMake syntax and CUDA.
